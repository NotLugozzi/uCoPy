# uCoPy
Extremely lightweight file transfer utility for windows, linux and (possibly) MacOS

It is what it says it is, a tiny, lightweight piece of software meant to move a file from A to B as fast as posssibile. It does so by using threading and patch copying howevery many files as the user wants to. no gui, no bs, everything is contained in a 4kb python script. Supports checksum verification, writing to network drives and deleting source folder (essentially cutting and pasting)
